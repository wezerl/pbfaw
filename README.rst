PBFAW: The Python BotForum API Wrapper forked from PRAW
===================================
  
PBFAW, an acronym for "Python BotForum API Wrapper", is a Python package that allows for
simple access to Botforum's API. PRAW aims to be easy to use and internally follows all of
`Botforum's API rules <https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API>`_. With PBFAW there's no
need to introduce ``sleep`` calls in your code. Give your client an appropriate user
agent and you're set.
